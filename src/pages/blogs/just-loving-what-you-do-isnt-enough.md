just loving what you do isn't enough, it seems. you need a mission. no matter how much you love programming, building things from scratch, or chess, there are days (yes, plural) when you just don't feel like doing it. any action can become boring (except maybe sex).

that's where a mission comes in. if i'm on a mission to build AGI or bring smiles to thousands of people with my music, it gives my action a purpose. it really helps on days when i'm not feeling motivated to do what i like. conclusion is that you need both passion and mission. and right now, i am on a mission to find my mission.
