we all have some desires that we've learnt not to even acknowledge, because they are "superficial", or bad, or any other stupid adjective. my question is why? what if you don't ignore them, and fulfill them while turning them into an advantage?

what if i told you that it's okay to be greedy... that it's okay to want to look good; it's okay to crave recognition?

i say that it's okay as long as you can capitalize on these "superficial" desires. i'm greedy, and i want social recognition. okay fine, i'm gonna build a _profitable_ business that provides value to my customers! that way i'm gonna print money, and also satisfy my desire for prestige. you wanna look good pretty boy? great! get fit as fuck and get em baddies.

it's much more productive to capitalize on these desires than trying to suppress them. and notice how the key word here is **capitalize**. to capitalize on something, you need to think rationally. you've to figure out how you can use this "superficial", and otherwise pointless desire, to your advantage.

if you're successfully able to do these two things:

1. deeply introspect and accept that yes, YOU, you have a "superficial" desire (this is difficult for most people imo)
2. and you can think rationally and figure out how you can capitalize on it (again difficult)

then it's not just a "superficial" desire anymore, it's your motivation now - your _superficial motivator_. this gives you both a goal to chase, the motivation to work towards it, and also the _why?_ - you wanna fulfill your desire.

remember, we all are flawed animals. you think you're not? fine. then how about this? your life is already pointless, so do yourself a favour and jump off your "these desires are beneath me" pedestal, Buddha.

so, what's your "superficial" ~desire~ motivator that you can capitalize on?
