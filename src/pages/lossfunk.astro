      <h1>hey Paras! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        i've applied for the Lossfunk residency and wanted to reach out directly. i'm currently a founding engineer at
        Outspeed (realtime voice AI infra startup, check
        <a href="https://outspeed.com" target="_blank">outspeed.com</a>).

      <h2>why i'm excited about Lossfunk?</h2>
      <p>
        i'm deeply curious, especially about model serving and inference, and i love understanding how things work
        internally. <a href="https://biraj21.github.io/from-scratch" target="_blank">[here's the proof]</a>. i also
        wanna be among people where i'm the dumbest one.
      </p>

      <h2>my 'from scratch' projects (AI related)</h2>
      <ul id="projects">
        <li>
          <h3>model serving from scratch</h3>
          <p>
            a toy model server built from scratch using FastAPI. has request queueing, batched inference, independent
            sequence completion, and token streaming via SSE. also supports batched inference for
            whisper-large-v3-turbo. built this to understand how systems like vLLM work internally (i'm not even close).
            next steps: dynamic batching and KV caching.
            <strong><u>this is what i wanna spend my time on at Lossfunk</u></strong>

          <h3>numpy from scratch in Go</h3>
          <p>
            i was implementing Neural Networks from scratch in Go and as a byproduct of it, i created my own version of
            NumPy for tensor operations like +, -, *, /, matrix multiplication, transpose etc. it also supports
            <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html" target="_blank">broadcasting</a>.

          <h3>tensor visualizer</h3>
          <p>
            a tool that helps you visualize multi-dimensional arrays. uses HTML canvas for rendering the image. i wrote
            this when i was trying to understand neural networks and tensors in pytorch.
            <strong>it's the most creative and original project i've ever built.</strong>

          <h3>ai answer engine</h3>
          <p>
            built a quick & fun answer engine inspired by perplexity & scira because why not. used qwen3-32b hosted on
            groq & used google's custom search JSON api for search results. it shows sources and model's reasoning in
            the UI, while citing the sources in the answer.
